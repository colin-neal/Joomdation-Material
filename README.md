Joomdation-Material

This repository contains an empty boilerplate Joomla 4/5 template (theme) that incorporates the Foundation 6 CSS framework (https://get.foundation) which was originally developed by Zurb, a Campbell, CA-based design firm. 
Material Foundation (https://github.com/mikolajdobrucki/material-foundation) theming was also included in this version of the template.

The template that I developed makes it easy for developers to convert and translate static websites that were built using Foundation 6 over to the Joomla CMS.
